# Hi there üëãüèª

I'm ‚ú® Audrey ‚ú®, a nerd obsessed with computing, cognition, and applied philosophy.

In my spare time, I'm experimenting with LLMs and agents because it seems less intimidating than writing a blog.

My first experiments concerned an agent framework, [stonekin.project](https://github.com/audreyality/stonekin.project). Coding is on hold while I develop a greater undertanding of [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) to flesh out the [project's domains](https://github.com/audreyality/stonekin.project/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-documentation.md).

While I flesh out my understanding, I'm building a virtual environment to host my experiments.

Some of the stuff I've done since becoming a contributor:

- I wrote the [credential generator packages](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/main/libs/tools/generator) for the JavaScript clients.
- For the 2025 Innovation Sprint, I helped build an [Achivements prototype](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/13766).
- I wrote an [ADR about TypeScript enums](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/adr/ts-deprecate-enums)!
