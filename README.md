# Hi there üëãüèª

I'm ‚ú® Audrey ‚ú®, a nerd obsessed with computing, cognition, and applied philosophy.

In my spare time, I'm experimenting with LLMs and agents because it seems less intimidating than writing a blog.

My first experiments concerned an agent framework, [stonekin.project](https://github.com/audreyality/stonekin.project). Coding is on hold while I develop a greater undertanding of [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) to flesh out the [project's domains](https://github.com/audreyality/stonekin.project/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-documentation.md).

My current focus is on understanding how to leverage agentic programming assistants on large codebases.

I was an open source enthusiast back in my college days. I don't have much to show off, but I do have many fond memories. A few years back, a colleague reached out asking if I'd like to return to my roots. It's been nearly two years and it's undoubtedly among the best decisions I've made.

Some of the stuff I've done since becoming a contributor:

- [x] I wrote the [credential generator packages](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/main/libs/tools/generator) for the JavaScript clients.
- [ ] A [generator deep dive](https://github.com/bitwarden/contributing-docs/pull/595) is coming soon!
- [ ] I'm also experimenting with [internal documentation](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/15018).
- [x] For the 2025 Innovation Sprint, I helped build an [Achivements prototype](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/13766).
- [x] I wrote an [ADR about TypeScript enums](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/adr/ts-deprecate-enums)!

I'm currently [adding features](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/pull/5857) to Bitwarden Send!

If projects like these excite you, consider applying! My team is [hiring a full stack engineer](https://bitwarden.com/careers/6602420003/)!
