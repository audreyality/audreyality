# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm ✨ Audrey ✨, a nerd obsessed with computing, cognition, and social sciences.

All of my tech projects, both professional and personal, are on hold while I sort out some personal matters.

Some of the stuff I've done since becoming a Bitwarden engineer:

- I wrote the [credential generator packages](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/main/libs/tools/generator) for the JavaScript clients.
- For the 2025 Innovation Sprint, I helped build an [Achivements prototype](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/13766).
- I wrote an [ADR about TypeScript enums](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/adr/ts-deprecate-enums).

My contributions to Bitwarden are made in a professional capacity. Everything else is just me being me.
