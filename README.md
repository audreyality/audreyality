# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm ✨ Audrey ✨, a nerd obsessed with computing, cognition, and applied philosophy.

In my spare time, I'm vibe coding an agent framework because it seems less intimidating than writing a blog. I'm two failures in!

* The first time I let Claude go wild, and it produced gorgeous nothing.
* The second time I gave it specific prompts but carte blanche tool access. Gorgeous spaghetti.
* This time I'm experimenting with context management, fine-grained tool permissions, and more sophisticated prompts.

🤞🏻 Here's hoping the third time's the charm!

I was an open source enthusiast back in my college days. I don't have much to show off, but I do have many fond memories. A few years back, a colleague reached out asking if I'd like to return to my roots. It's been nearly two years and it's undoubtedly among the best decisions I've made.

Some of the stuff I've done since becoming a contributor:

- [x] I wrote the [credential generator packages](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/main/libs/tools/generator) for the JavaScript clients.
- [ ] A [generator deep dive](https://github.com/bitwarden/contributing-docs/pull/595) is coming soon!
- [ ] I'm also experimenting with [internal documentation](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/15018).
- [x] For the 2025 Innovation Sprint, I helped build an [Achivements prototype](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/13766).
- [x] I wrote an [ADR about TypeScript enums](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/adr/ts-deprecate-enums)!

I'm currently [adding features](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/pull/5857) to Bitwarden Send!

If projects like these excite you, consider applying! My team is [hiring a full stack engineer](https://bitwarden.com/careers/6602420003/)!
