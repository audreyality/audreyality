# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm ✨ Audrey ✨, a nerd obsessed with computing, cognition, and applied philosophy.

In my spare time, I'm experimenting with LLMs and agents because it seems less intimidating than writing a blog.

My first experiments concerned an agent framework, [stonekin.project](https://github.com/audreyality/stonekin.project). Coding is on hold while I develop a greater undertanding of [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) to flesh out the [project's domains](https://github.com/audreyality/stonekin.project/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-documentation.md).

My current focus is building a virtual environment to host my experiments.
