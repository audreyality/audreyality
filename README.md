# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm ✨ Audrey ✨, a nerd obsessed with computing, cognition, and applied philosophy.

In my spare time, I'm vibe coding an agent framework because it seems less intimidating than writing a blog. I'm two failures in!

* The first time I let Claude go wild, and it produced gorgeous nothing.
* The second time I gave it a ton of domain knowledge, but not enough technical direction.
* This time I'm experimenting with instructions, fine-grained context and tool management, and more sophisticated prompts.

🤞🏻 Here's hoping the third time's the charm!
