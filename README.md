# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm âœ¨ Audrey âœ¨, an engineer at Bitwarden!

My team is [looking for a full stack engineer](https://bitwarden.com/careers/6602420003/)!

Some of my accomplishments:

* I wrote the [credential generator packages](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/main/libs/tools/generator) for the JavaScript clients. [Documentation](https://github.com/bitwarden/contributing-docs/pull/595) coming soon!
* For the 2025 Innovation Sprint, I helped build an [Achivements prototype](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/pull/13766).
* I wrote an [ADR about TypeScript enums](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/adr/ts-deprecate-enums)!

At work, I'm [adding features](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/pull/5857) to Bitwarden Send!

In my spare time, I'm vibe coding an agent framework because it seems less intimidating than writing a blog. I'm two failures in!

* The first time I let Claude go wild, and it produced gorgeous nothing.
* The second time it got crushed by a lack of instructions and workflow.
* This time I'm coming with instructions, fine-grained context and tool management, domain knowledge, and workflows!
